# Terpbuy Sales Analysis
> TerpBuy is a global business-to-consumer and business-to-business platform. The company is looking for insights on different aspects of its customers, products, departments, and orders.



## General Information
- This project uses [MySQL queries](https://github.com/drcnavad/MySQL_TerpbuySales/blob/main/TERPBUY%20PROJECT%20ASSIGNMENT.pdf) to analyse various aspects of the dataset. The visualizations are created using [Python](https://github.com/drcnavad/MySQL_TerpbuySales/blob/main/TERPBUY%20ASSIGNMENT.ipynb). The executive summary is provided in a plain [pdf file](https://github.com/drcnavad/MySQL_TerpbuySales/blob/main/Terpbuy%20Executive%20Summary.pdf).



## Executive Summary
* The company sales decreased in past 2 years which can be attributed to few factors in the dataset.

* The number of orders with delayed shipping are high and Terpbuyâ€™s should try to minimize these delays in shipping products.

* Terpbuy has a wide product offering in multiple departments, however, items from certain departments such as Book shop, Technology, Pet Shop and Health & Beauty has a very low sale. The company should invest more on higher selling department items such as Apparel, Fan shop, and Golf items.

* The dataset fails to mention above inventory stock, which may be useful to analyze further in-stock and out-of-stock items. Analyzing these data will help to reduce the inventory cost by removing excess inventory and maintain minimum stock for high-selling items.

* Further analysis is needed to analyze the external factors such as COVID, product price, customer satisfaction, customer service, and other factors affecting the decrease in total sales. The company has wide range of customer base all over the US and improving certain logistical and inventory factors will help to increase the sales over the coming years.
